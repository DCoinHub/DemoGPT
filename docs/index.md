# 🧩 Welcome to DemoGPT Documentation

As DemoGPT team, we transform a static idea into a dynamic product. Our ultimate goal is to democratize software development and make application development simple, efficient, and accessible.

## 📜 Brief Description

Our value proposition is creating fully functional LLM-based applications from a prompt. 

## 🛠️ Core Functionalities

DemoGPT's core functionalities revolve around four main steps:

1. **Planning:** DemoGPT starts by generating a plan from the user's instruction.
2. **Task Creation:** It then creates specific tasks from the plan and instruction.
3. **Code Snippet Generation:** These tasks are transferred into code snippets.
4. **Final Code Assembly:** The code snippets are combined into a final code, resulting in an interactive Streamlit app.

These functionalities allow DemoGPT to transform user instructions into interactive applications, making it a powerful tool for LLM-based application development.

## 🗂️ Project Structure

The project is organized into several modules and files. Here's a brief overview of the project structure:

- [src/plan/](./src_plan.md)
- [src/plan/chains/](./src_plan_chains.md)
