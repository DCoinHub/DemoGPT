# Welcome to DemoGPT Documentation

![DemoGPT Logo](img/puzzle_24.png) DemoGPT is an open-source project that leverages the power of Large Language Models (LLM) to auto-generate LangChain code, which is then transformed into interactive Streamlit applications. This process is powered by the synergy of GPT-3.5-turbo & Llama 2.

## Brief Description

DemoGPT is a revolutionary initiative reshaping the landscape of LLM-based application development. By combining the capabilities of GPT-3.5-turbo and Llama 2, DemoGPT auto-generates LangChain code, which is then transformed into interactive Streamlit applications. This process is enriched with a sophisticated architecture that translates user instructions into interactive applications. DemoGPT is more than a project; it's a visionary approach, pushing the boundaries of what's possible in LLM-based application development.

## Core Functionalities

DemoGPT's core functionalities revolve around four main steps:

1. **Planning:** DemoGPT starts by generating a plan from the user's instruction.
2. **Task Creation:** It then creates specific tasks from the plan and instruction.
3. **Code Snippet Generation:** These tasks are transferred into code snippets.
4. **Final Code Assembly:** The code snippets are combined into a final code, resulting in an interactive Streamlit app.

These functionalities allow DemoGPT to transform user instructions into interactive applications, making it a powerful tool for LLM-based application development.

## Project Structure

The project is organized into several modules and files. Here's a brief overview of the project structure:

- [src/plan/](./src_plan.md)
- [src/plan/chains/](./src_plan_chains.md)
- [src/plan/chains/prompts/](./src_plan_chains_prompts.md)
