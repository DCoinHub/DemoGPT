This process is powered by the synergy of GPT-3.5-turbo & Llama 2. Brief Description DemoGPT is a revolutionary initiative reshaping the landscape of LLM-based application development. By combining the capabilities of GPT-3.5-turbo and Llama 2, DemoGPT auto-generates LangChain code, which is then transformed into interactive Streamlit applications. This process is enriched with a sophisticated architecture that translates user instructions into interactive applications. DemoGPT is more than a project; it's a visionary approach, pushing the boundaries of what's possible in LLM-based application development. Core Functionalities DemoGPT's core functionalities revolve around four main steps: Planning: DemoGPT starts by generating a plan from the user's instruction. Task Creation: It then creates specific tasks from the plan and instruction. Code Snippet Generation: These tasks are transferred into code snippets. Final Code Assembly: The code snippets are combined into a final code, resulting in an interactive Streamlit app. These functionalities allow DemoGPT to transform user instructions into interactive applications, making it a powerful tool for LLM-based application development. Project Structure The project is organized into several modules and files.

The user can input their idea, and the application will generate code, refine it, test it, and display the results. The Streamlit web app allows users to interact with the model in real time, which is particularly useful for demonstrating the capabilities of the models. Application Flow Importing Dependencies At the beginning of the application, all necessary modules such as streamlit , model , os , logging , webbrowser , and signal are imported. The logging level is set to DEBUG with the format 'levelname-message'. Loading Environment Variables The application tries to load environment variables using the dotenv module. If the module is not present, it logs an error message but continues to execute the application. Generate Response The function generate_response uses the LogicModel to generate responses for the given text. It's a generator function yielding the output of the LogicModel in each iteration. Streamlit Configuration The title of the Streamlit page is set using st.set_page_config . Input Fields Input fields for the OpenAI API Key, demo title, and demo idea are created using st.sidebar.text_input , st.text_input , and st.text_area respectively. The OpenAI API Key defaults to the value of the environment variable 'OPENAI_API_KEY'. Submission Form A form is created to handle the submission of user input. If the user submits the form, the application checks if a valid OpenAI API Key is entered. If not, it displays a warning message. If the input is valid, instances of LogicModel and StreamlitModel are created with the provided OpenAI API Key. Running the Model The application then enters a loop where it generates, refines, tests and executes code using the LogicModel . The progress of this process is displayed on a Streamlit progress bar. If the code execution is successful, it launches a new Streamlit application running the generated code and opens the new application in the web browser. In case the execution was not successful, the application refines the code and retries. If all attempts are unsuccessful, it reports a failure.","title":"Streamlit Application Documentation"},{"location":"app/#streamlit-application-documentation","text":"","title":"Streamlit Application Documentation"},{"location":"app/#introduction","text":"This Python Streamlit application uses LogicModel and StreamlitModel from the model module to generate and execute Python code based on user input.
