Integration Steps: 1. Import the necessary module: from demogpt import DemoGPT 2.Instantiate the DemoGPT agent: To initialize the DemoGPT agent, use the DemoGPT class. It accepts three arguments: model_name : Specifies the name of the model you wish to use. By default, this is set to \"gpt-3.5-turbo-0613\" . openai_api_key : This is where you input your OpenAI API key. If you haven't set the OPENAI_API_KEY in your environment variables, you can pass it directly using this argument. max_steps : This determines the number of steps used for refining the model's response during the internal workflow. By default, this is set 10 agent = DemoGPT(model_name=\"gpt-3.5-turbo-0613\", openai_api_key=\"YOUR_API_KEY\", max_steps=10) 3.Set your instruction and title: instruction = \"Your instruction here\" title = \"Your title here\" 4.Iterate through the generation stages and extract the final code: code = \"\" for phase in agent(instruction=instruction, title=title): print(phase) # This will display the resulting JSON for each generation stage. if phase[\"done\"]: code = phase[\"code\"] # Extract the final code. print(code) Generation Stages: DemoGPT progresses through various stages to produce the final code. During each stage, it returns a JSON object containing the following key-value pairs: stage : The current stage, which could be \"plan\", \"task\", \"draft\", or \"final\". completed : A boolean indicating whether the stage has completed. percentage : Represents the progress percentage of the code generation. done : A boolean indicating if the entire process has been completed. message : An informational message about the current stage's status.

Test Methods setUpClass : This method is executed once at the start of the testing process. It sets up the environment required for testing. writeToFile : A helper method to write the test results to a file. printRes : A helper method to print the results in a colorful, formatted manner. test_plan : Tests the plan creation. test_tasks : Tests the task creation. test_final : Tests the final code generation. test_task_ui_input_text : Tests UI input text task. test_task_ui_output_text : Tests UI output text task. test_task_prompt_chat_template : Tests prompt chat template task. test : This method runs the entire workflow of the application, from plan creation to code generation. test_all : This method iterates over all the test cases in TEST_CASES and runs the test method for each of them. How to run tests Running all tests To run all the tests, use the following command: python -m unittest src.plan.test.TestDemoGPT.test_all Running a single test module To run a specific test module, you can use the following command format: python -m unittest src.plan.test.TestDemoGPT.$func_name","title":"Test"},{"location":"test/#testdemogpt-unit-testing","text":"TestDemoGPT is a class that contains a series of unit tests to validate the functionality of our application.","title":"TestDemoGPT - Unit Testing"},{"location":"test/#test-scenario","text":"The test scenario involves planning, task generation, code generation and testing of various tasks in the application like UI input text, UI output text, etc. The test plan uses various test cases defined in TEST_CASES and TOOL_EXAMPLES .","title":"Test Scenario"},{"location":"test/#test-methods","text":"setUpClass : This method is executed once at the start of the testing process.
